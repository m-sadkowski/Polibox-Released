# POLIBOX

POLIBOX is a comprehensive platform designed to assist students of Universities of Technology. This project, built using Django, provides various resources and tools to facilitate the academic journey of students. The backend is almost ready, needing more security and some small improvements. The frontend should be redesigned, but I am not really into it.
